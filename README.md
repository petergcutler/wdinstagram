## Before You Start...

Hooray, a quiz! [https://wdidc6.typeform.com/to/cSxB3l](https://wdidc6.typeform.com/to/cSxB3l)

##WDInstagram

### Prompt
Today you're going to make your own version of Instagram (or something very close to it!). Your photo feed app will have full CRUD capability and operate on a single Entry model.

An Entry has the following:

* `author`
* `photo_url`
* `date_taken`

Your app should have the following RESTful actions:

* index (displays all entries)
* show (displays a specific entry)
* new (displays a form to create a new entry)
* create (saves a new entry it to the database)
* edit (displays a form for editing a particular entry)
* update (takes input from the edit form and updates the entry in the db appropriately)
* destroy (deletes a specific entry from the database)

### Instructions

1. Write 5 user stories for your app.
  * Keep it simple and think about what functionality your MVP needs.

  * As a user, I want to be able to upload pictures to share with friends
  * As a user, I want to be able to remove pictures I have uploaded, to save myself from embarassment
  * As a user, I want to be able to see multiple author's pictures so I can keep up with
  others
  * As a user I want to be able to edit/update pictures I have uploaded to modify my original submissions
  * As a user I want to be able to write a caption with photos, to share funny comments.

2. Create a database: `$ createdb wdinstagram`
3. Create an Entry model

4. Create a `wdinstagram_schema.sql` schema file and generate a table for your Entry model.
  * When ready, migrate your schema into PSQL: `$ psql -d wdinstagram < db/schema.sql`


5. Create seed data in `$ db/seeds.rb`
  * When ready, run your seeds file: `$ ruby db/seeds.rb`

  
6. Create routes for your app, mapping them to the RESTful actions listed above

7. Create the views for your routes

### Bonus

1. Add a column for `caption` to your Entry, which is a text description of the shot. You'll need to generate a database migration for this and then update the rest of your app to be able to display these captions.
2. Add "Like" functionality to your posts.
3. Create a route that shows all the posts by a given author.
4. Add a second "Comments" model to your app so that users may leave comments on each of your Entries.
5. Give your Comments model full CRUD capability.

### Bonus<sup>2</sup>

**NOTE:** Some of these stretch goals may require research on subjects not yet covered in class.

1. Add client-side validation to your Entry model. `name` and `photo_url` need to be present, and the `date_taken` should be more recent than 10/1/2010.

2. Move your form for new entries to the index (i.e., you won't have a separate page for creating posts).
3. Do the same for comments.
